Hello everyone! Welcome to my website. My name is Alex Johnson, and I am a 2nd year Ph.D. student in Applied Math at the University of Washington. I have the pleasure of being advised by [Sasha Aravkin](https://uw-amo.github.io/saravkin/) with whom I broadly work on problems related to (convex and non-convex) optimization and optimal transport, with applications to machine learning. I am also a graduate student researcher at the [IHME](https://www.healthdata.org/) where I've been working on applying convex optimization techniques to support statistical tools that improve population health estimates.

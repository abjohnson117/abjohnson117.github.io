Hello everyone! Welcome to my website. My name is Alex Johnson, and I am a 2nd year Ph.D. student in Applied Math at the University of Washington. I have the pleasure of being advised by [Sasha Aravkin](https://uw-amo.github.io/saravkin/). I broadly work on problems related to modelling through (convex and non-convex) optimization techniques, with a focus on problems related to statistical inference and machine learning. Additionally, I study problems related to the optimal transport of measure and finding applications in sampling problems. I am also a graduate student researcher at the [IHME](https://www.healthdata.org/) where I've been working on applying variational analysis and disciplined convex programming to support meta rgression tools that improve population health estimates.
